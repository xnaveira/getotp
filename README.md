# GETOTP

Get your otp password generated by totp.

The program tries to read the environment variable **OTP_SECRET**, otherwise prompts for the secret.

The output is your one time password that can be piped to, for example, your clipboard.

When setting your environment variable in bash you might want to leave a space at the beginning of the line so it doesn't get saved to history.
